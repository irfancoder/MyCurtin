# MyCurtin

Welcome to the MyCurtin app codebase. Developed by the MyCurtin Team and a project by [The Founders Club](https://founders.my), this application was made to be open-source for future developers like you to gain inspiration from. My only wish from open sourcing this codebase is to help people like you who want to better themselves.

Inside, you will find the nastiest code you might read with no proper consistent documentation, so thread carefully. If you have any questions on how certain code works or doesn't work, please let me know.

Regards,
Irfan
