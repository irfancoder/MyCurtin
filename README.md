# MyCurtin

Welcome to the MyCurtin app codebase. Developed by the MyCurtin Team, this application was decided to be open-source for people like you to gain inspiration from.

Inside, you will find the nastiest code you might read with no proper consistent documentation, so thread carefully. If you have any questions on how certain code works or doesn't work, please let me know.

Regards,
Irfan
